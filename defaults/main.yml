# Squid ACLS - This is a list of ACLs and default directives ( allow or deny ) for those ACLs

#squid_acls: {} # These are designed to be passed in as required
# Assuming the following config:
# squid_acls:
#    safe_ports:
#        source: [ 80,21 ]
#        type: port
#        directive: "http_access allow"
#        additional_directive_acl: [ "!SSL_ports" ]
#        seq_number: 100
#
# Would generate the config to define "safe_ports" as:
#
# acl safe_ports port 80
# acl safe_ports port 21
#
# and then using the optional directive entry (ordered by seq_number)
#
# http_access allow safe_ports
#
# additional_directive_acl is not required but any other ACLs in this list would be appended to the end of the directive
# and require all the ACLs to be matched before the rule is applied:
#
# http_access allow safe_ports !SSL_ports
#
